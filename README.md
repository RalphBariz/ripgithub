# #RIPGitHub
for my repos go to https://gitlab.com/RalphBariz

Due to GitHub's decision to sleep over at the enemy of open and free software, namely Microsoft, I won't use this account for hosting my code any more. Yes Microsoft, you have proven multiple times to be anything else but trustworthy.

It was a beautiful time with GitHub, but everything seems to have an end.
