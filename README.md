# ripgithub
for my repos go to https://gitlab.com/RalphBariz

Due to the fact that GitHub decided to jump into bed with the enemy of open and free software, namely Microsoft, I won't use this account for hosting my code any more.

#RIPGitHub, it was a beautiful time, but everything seems to have an end.
